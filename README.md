# Introduction
PathLabReport is a web app that helps pathologists to manage their pathology reports and keep track of the medical cases
they encountered. It also let the patients visualize their diagnosis by signing into their account.
The main purpose of this app was for me to learn programming in python and create a web app using some of the most 
popular technologies like django, mysql, react.
